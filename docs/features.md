## Feature Definitions

### FEAT-0002 — Knowledge Injection

**Issue**: [#131](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/edgequake/issues/131)  
**Spec**: [specifications/0002_knowledge_injection_issue_131](../specifications/0002_knowledge_injection_issue_131/)  
**Released**: v0.8.0 (2026-04-03)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Problem**: Domain-specific acronyms (OEE, NLP) and synonyms are unknown to the embedding model. Queries for "OEE" miss documents that say "Overall Equipment Effectiveness", degrading retrieval quality.

**Solution**: Workspace owners inject glossary definitions as named entries. These are processed through the standard entity-extraction pipeline, enriching the knowledge graph. At query time, injection entities expand the query terms. Injection entries are **never shown as source citations**.

**API Surface**:
- `PUT /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection` — create/replace text injection
- `POST /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection/upload` — upload file injection
- `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection` — list all entries
- `GET /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection/:injection_id` — get detail
- `PATCH /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection/:injection_id` — update name/content
- `DELETE /api/v1/workspaces/:id/injection/:injection_id` — delete + cascade cleanup

**UI**: `/knowledge` page with list, add dialog (text/file tabs), detail page, inline edit, delete confirmation.

**Test Coverage**: 1 000+ line Rust E2E suite + 5 Playwright browser tests.

### FEAT-0005 — Custom Entity Configuration

**Issue**: [#85](https://github.com/raphaelmansuy/edgequake/issues/85)  
**Spec**: [specifications/0005_custom_entity_config_issue_85](../specifications/0005_custom_entity_config_issue_85/)  
**Released**: v0.8.0 (2026-04-03)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Problem**: Default generic entity types are insufficient for domain-specific corpora (manufacturing, healthcare, legal, research, finance), reducing extraction recall and graph quality.

**Solution**: Workspace creation supports `entity_types` with preset-driven and custom configuration. Types are normalized and stored in workspace metadata, then automatically injected into extraction prompts per workspace.

**Capabilities**:
- Workspace-scoped `entity_types` in create-workspace API payload.
- Validation and normalization: trim, uppercase, space/hyphen to underscore, dedupe, max 50.
- Pipeline fallback to server defaults when no custom entity types are configured.
- Frontend selector with presets (General, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Legal, Research, Finance) and custom add/remove chips.
- Workspace detail page displays configured entity types.
- Full i18n labels in en/fr/zh.

**API Surface**:
- `POST /api/v1/tenants/:tenant_id/workspaces` accepts `entity_types`.
- Workspace response surfaces `entity_types` (from metadata JSONB).

**Test Coverage**:
- Rust integration coverage for workspace request/metadata threading.
- Playwright coverage for selector UX edge cases and workspace detail display.

### FEAT-010 — Configurable PDF Parser Backend

**Spec**: [mission/03-pdf-parser.md](../mission/03-pdf-parser.md)  
**Released**: v0.10.0 (2026-04-10)  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Problem**: Vision-only PDF extraction is expensive, slower on digital-native PDFs, and
unnecessarily dependent on an LLM for documents that already contain structured text.

**Solution**: EdgeQuake now supports two runtime PDF extraction backends:
- `vision` for scanned, image-heavy, or layout-complex PDFs.
- `edgeparse` for fast CPU-only extraction of digital-native PDFs.

**Resolution order**:
- Per-upload multipart override `pdf_parser_backend`
- Workspace default `workspace.pdf_parser_backend`
- Environment variable `EDGEQUAKE_PDF_PARSER_BACKEND`
- Fallback default `vision`

**Capabilities**:
- New `edgequake-pdf` abstraction crate with a backend strategy pattern.
- EdgeParse integration via `edgeparse-core` without temp files.
- Workspace-level default parser setting on the workspace configuration page (`/workspace` and
  `/w/[slug]/workspace`).
- Per-upload parser selection in the document upload flow via the `Parser for this upload`
  selector, including a `Workspace Default` option.
- Extraction lineage includes parser method and low-content warnings for image-only PDFs.
- EdgeParse markdown is sanitized before persistence to remove embedded NUL bytes that PostgreSQL
  rejects as invalid UTF-8 payload.
- Storage now records `extraction_method = edgeparse`.

**Operational note**:
- EdgeParse does not auto-fallback to Vision. If output is low-content, the UI surfaces a warning
  so the user can explicitly retry with Vision.
